# Challenge-1-Horiseon

Horiseon Website Cleanup (Challenge 1)

For Challenge 1 I cleaned up some of the HTML and CSS by consilidating certain elements. As far as the HTML file, I saw there were some unecessary divs and renamed them such as article and header to use semantics, fixed the search engine optimization in the navigation section, and added commentary.

In CSS, I grouped properties together to cut down on the amount of declarations. I also reduced the amount of fonts that were listed because I thought listing 5-8 fonts seemed unnecessary.

I also created a new repository on GitHub for the challenge.
